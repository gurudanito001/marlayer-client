          This hands-on course provides an in-depth introduction to JavaScript, the foundation of modern web development, and React, the popular JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. Students will start with the essentials of JavaScript, focusing on its syntax, data structures, and core programming concepts. Through a series of practical exercises, they&apos;ll develop strong programming fundamentals, including functions, asynchronous programming, and working with APIs.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-light mt-5 mb-5">
          Once students are comfortable with JavaScript, the course will transition into React, where they&apos;ll learn to build powerful, scalable, and dynamic front-end applications. Key React topics will include state management, component-based architecture, hooks, and the context API. Students will also learn to integrate third-party libraries, manage application state effectively, and optimize for performance.
